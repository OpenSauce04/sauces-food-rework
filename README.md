# Sauce's Hunger Rework
#### A hunger rework mod designed to bridge the gap between the old hunger system and the new hunger system
Requires AppleCore and AppleSkin

This resource pack is recommended with this mod: [Melon Hunger Bar (for Sauce's Hunger Rework)](https://www.planetminecraft.com/texture-pack/melon-hunger-bar-for-sauce-s-hunger-rework/)
<br>
### Key points:
#### 1. Player actions such as running no longer reduce hunger

#### 2. You now heal using your hunger bar directly

#### 3. Food is now only consumed when required to heal

#### 4. Running out of hunger does not limit your movement

#### 5. You are only able to eat while you have no hunger points

Note: Resource packs that change the hunger bar textures will not work properly with this mod unless they were specifically made to be compatible with this mod
