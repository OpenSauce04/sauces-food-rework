# Sauce's Hunger Rework
#### A hunger rework mod designed to bridge the gap between the old food system and the new hunger system
This mod requires AppleCore and AppleSkin
<br>
### Key points:
#### 1. Player actions such as running no longer reduce hunger

#### 2. You now heal using your hunger bar directly

#### 3. Food is now only consumed when required to heal

#### 4. Running out of hunger does not limit your movement

#### 5. You are only able to eat while you have no hunger points
